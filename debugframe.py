# This script will be executed every "debug frame".
# A debug frame is created whenever you call "breakpoint()" from JavaScript.
#
# The purpose of this script is to:
#    1) Send our remote debugger the result of the last command.
#    2) Wait until code is entered and sent to us by the remote debugger.
#    3) Write to stdout the code entered into the remote debugger.
#
# This code written to stdout by this script will be eval()'d in JavaScript
# and the result set as the last command.
